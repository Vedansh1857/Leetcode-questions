Problem statement -> You have n dice, and each die has k faces numbered from 1 to k.
Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible ways (out of the kn total ways) to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers equals target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
